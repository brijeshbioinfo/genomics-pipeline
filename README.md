## üå± Project Overview

This repository contains modular and customizable bioinformatics workflows designed to analyze large-scale genomic data for plant breeding and functional genomics. The focus is on applying transcriptomics, genome-wide association studies, and integrative omics for the discovery of trait-associated genes and development of molecular markers.
